# Incidents Crowdsourcing System - GP
It's an application where people could report incidents happening either around them or to them ( theft , robbery , harassement , roadblocks , etc ).

The application shows that in a timeline to people either close to the incident or subscribed to the area , also departments of water and electricity could issue warnings of power or water cuts before it happens ,from the incidents reported, crimes could be predicted to happen in a particular area at a particular time , high and low crime hotspots. More details will be updated soon.
